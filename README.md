# Installation
The .ipynb file can be used with jupyter notebooks. Please see here(https://jupyter.org/install) for installation details.
The data files in the data folder need to be extracted first and placed in a "data" directory right next to the .ipynb file.

Project Motivation
This project was the last project in the Data Science Nanodegree program of Udacity. It was a very fascinating project to work on.
The data was a bit messy in the beginning and the amount of data was overwhelming in the beginning. After some initial data wrangling, the complete
extend of the dataset could be imagined and some interesting findings were made. 
For an overview about the findings, I refer to the blog post. For more details about data treatment and a closer look at the findings, I refer to the jupyter notebook.
